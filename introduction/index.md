# The SQL language 👨‍🚀

SQL is a tool for organizing, managing and retrieving data stored by a computer database. The original named by IBM was **Structured English Query Language** which we often call is **SEQUEL**. **SQL** - the shorten named by the Hawker Siddeley Aircraft Company of the United Kingdom after was a trademark owner. But somehow both them are correct.

SQL is a computer language that you can work with the database. In real life, you are often working with a special type of database and in SQL we are called it is the **relational database**.

The computer program that controls the database is called a database management system (DBMS).

When we use SQL to make request. The DBMS processes that request and retrieves the requested data and returns it to us. Whole this process we is called **query** - hence the name **Structured** ***Query*** **Language**.

# Database Management System (DBMS) 🏢
SQL is used to control all the functions in DBMS. It's include many tools to process data in the database.

- Data definition: allows a user define the structure and organization of the stored data and relations.
- Data retrieval: allows a user or and application program retrieve stored data and use it from the database.
- Data manipulation: allows a user or an application program to retrieve stored data from the database and use it.
- Access control: used to restrict a user permission to protected data.
- Data sharing: used to coordinate data sharing by the current users to make sure that changes at the same time will not impact another one.
- Data integrity: used to defines integrity constraints in the database. Protected it from inconsistent updates or system failures.


### Summary:
- SQL is comprehensive language for controlling and interacting with the database management system.
- SQL is not really a computer language like C++, C, Java,...
- SQL is a database sublanguage.
- SQL statements can be embedded into another language.
- SQL is used to control all the functions in DBMS.
